            <h2>What Makes a Hero?</h2>
            <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes emobdy what we truly value most. Therefore role models say a lot about who we are.</p>
            <p> I believe the person who truly embodies these qualities is tennis player Coco Gauff. Her hard work and resiliance is very admirable, especially considering that she is only 19 years old! </p>
